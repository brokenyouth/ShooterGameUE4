# ShooterGameUE4

First Person Shooter Game developed using the Unreal Engine.

The game is inspired by the famous Counter-Strike.
The idea is that there are two teams: Red and Blue. Any team that reaches a certain amount of kills will win the game.
Players will be able to play by joining a server and selecting a team - they will then be spawned close to their teammates and will have to make kills in order to win.

Game is in "Work in Progress" state - here are some screenshots:
